\chapter{Abstract}
This document aims to analyze and describe the usability characteristics of an application. Usability is a measure of "the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which specified users can achieve specified goals in particular environments" (ISO 9241-11).
The website to be inspected is (\url{www.tim.it}).

\chapter{Introduction}
In the next chapter four scenarios are described. A scenario describes a user that tries to accomplish an objective, and the steps made by him/her. Each scenario is hence provided with a result section in which is described the evaluation of the heuristics of the pages visited by the user. Every member of this working group has performed an inspection of each page, the results have been discussed, and this document reports a wrap up of those results. The heuristics used for the analysis are the ones described by the MiLE (Milano-Lugano Evaluation Method) document.\\
The website evaluated is \url{www.tim.it}. This site provides services, products, promotions regarding in particular phone communication.
