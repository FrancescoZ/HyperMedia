\chapter{Abstract}
\thispagestyle{fancy}
The following document contains the IDM diagrams: C-IDM, L-IDM and P-IDM schemas of our website. We will also discuss about the scenario of a potential user and we show in the end a mockup explaining how the flow of the site works. We've used Balsamiq as prototyping tool for the interactive mockup and draw.io to built the IDM schemas. The wireframes inserted in this document will not contain the hyperlink of the interactive mockup. To completely use the potential of our mockup it is necessary to use the correspondent pdf.
